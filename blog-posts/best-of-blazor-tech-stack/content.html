<p>Hello Blazor community!</p>
<p>I'm Arjun Kumar, the creator of the "Best of Blazor" blog. Allow me to share my journey.</p>
<p>Some time back, a guy named Vetri Maran kickstarted a blog named "Best of Blazor." Given that Blazor was still relatively new, it immediately caught my attention. The blog flourished, attracting various contributors along the way. It swiftly became my favorite due to the invaluable insights it offered, which I couldn't easily gather myself. However, after a while, the blog disappeared without a trace, leaving me in shock.</p>
<p>Fast forward to October 2023, and I have had the opportunity to resurrect this beloved blog. This time around, I aspire to retain the essence of the original blog while injecting fresh content, making it larger and better than before.</p>
<p>A heartfelt thank you goes to Blazor School and, specifically, Huy Tran for lending a helping hand in rebuilding this blog. Huy Tran is more than just a mentor; he's a knowledgeable guide and a true leader.</p>
<p>But let's return to the main focus of this inaugural post&mdash;the technology stack that brought "Best of Blazor" back to life:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p><div>Blazor Server:</div> Blazor forms the core of this blog's frontend, enabling the creation of interactive and dynamic web applications using C# instead of traditional frontend languages like JavaScript. It's fast, it's easy.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><div>GitHub Authentication:</div> Utilizing GitHub for server-to-server authentication, we've ensured website security with minimal effort.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><div>Visual Studio:</div> My primary code editor of choice, Visual Studio, was selected for its flexibility, extensive extension library, and seamless integration with .NET and Blazor development.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><div>Hostinger:</div> For hosting, Hostinger proved to be a cost-effective choice at just $6 per month. It's stable, affordable, and boasts excellent support. If you're considering hosting, I highly recommend using our Best of Blazor referral link for a 20% discount <a href="https://hostinger.com?REFERRALCODE=1BLAZOR52" target="_new">here</a>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><div>highlight.js:</div> I've employed highlight.js to bring color to the code. While it's not perfect, it's a fast and straightforward choice.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><div>SQLite:</div> Choosing SQLite for data storage was a strategic move due to its lightweight nature. Unlike SQL Server, it doesn't demand extensive RAM (thus reducing hosting costs), yet it remains fast and easy to use. Plus, with Entity Framework, database management becomes a breeze.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>With this technology stack, my aim was to create a blog that not only reflects my passion for Blazor but also provides you, the reader, with a seamless browsing experience.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more engaging posts in the future. See you later!</p>
